# Sample overlay bundle to deploy Ironic with Contrail+OpenStack

This readme was prepared for Ubuntu 18.04. To deploy it in Ubuntu 20.04 please use innodb instead of mysql/percona.
Prepare Juju setup with openstack Train and ironic overlay bundle:

```bash
juju deploy --overlay=./ironic-bundle.yaml ./bundle.yaml
```

or you can add ironic in a same way after deployment of main bundle:

```bash
juju deploy --overlay=./ironic-bundle.yaml --map-machines=existing ./bundle.yaml
```

Please note - if you have network bindings in main bundle file then you have to replicate it to octaviaâ€™s bundle.

To deploy this overlay you need to have ceph in your main bundle. Please refer to Canonical's docs how to deploy it.
This overlay add ironic-api, ironic-conductor, nova-compute in ironic mode and contrail-agent in CSN mode.
For detailed information about ironic please check its page <https://jaas.ai/u/openstack-charmers/ironic-conductor>
